### Summary
Traditional ways of getting a molecule's properties, (such as the HOMO-LUMO gap, the Hartree energy or a simple atomization energy) involve the use of quantum chemical simulations. Although these simulations are able to provide us with really accurate results, they are very computationally extensive and take a long time to complete. Another traditional method is the use of Molecular Dynamics simulations which make use of Newtonian force fields and are faster than quantum simulations. There is a clear tradeoff of performance for time here. The aim of this project is to achieve the results of quantum simulations while not compromising on time by the use of neural networks.
