### Summary
Chemistry Solver is an application designed to help solve common chemistry problems offered in an introductory or general chemistry course. It's currently a work in process, but it's planned to include tools for Equation Balancing, Combustion Analysis, Stoichiometry, Empirical Formula Derivation, a Periodic Table, and Unit Conversion.

### How to Install
Chemistry Solver was created in Visual Studio using C# and must be built from source code. In order to install and run the program, go [here](https://github.com/Hoshiningen/Chemistry-Solver) and clone the project to your local repository. Double clicking the solution file will import the project into Visual Studio, which will allow you to build and run it.
