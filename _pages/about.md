### Mission Statement
This website is my portfolio, and also a place where I can share my passion for different topics that interest me. I believe that having a website like this will allow me to have an audience that would be more likely to understand the things I'm discussing. This website will be my avenue of expression, and so the contents of the blog posts will most likely not be isolated to a single topic, but will span a broad range of nerdy and _exciting_ things!


### How to Contact
My contact information is on the left side of the window, where the author profile is displayed. In addition, there is a comments section under every blog post. I welcome all feedback and discussion!
