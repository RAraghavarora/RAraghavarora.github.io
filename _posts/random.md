> “The men where you live,” said the little prince, “raise five thousand roses in the same garden – and they do not find in it what they are looking for.”  
> “They do not find it,” I replied.  
> “And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water.”  
> And the little prince added: "But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart..."
