I will like to hopefully organize this properly some day...

> “The men where you live,” said the little prince, “raise five thousand roses in the same garden – and they do not find in it what they are looking for.”  
> “They do not find it,” I replied.  
> “And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water.”  
> And the little prince added: "But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart..."

— Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince

> “We make things beyond what we understand, as we always have done. Steam engines worked before we had a theory of thermodynamics; vaccines were developed before we knew how the immune system works; aircraft continue to fly to this day, despite the many gaps in our understanding of aerodynamics. When theory lags behind application, there will always be mathematical surprises lying in wait. The important thing is that we learn from these inevitable mistakes and don’t repeat them.”
